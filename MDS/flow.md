Explanation:
A → B: The process starts with a business idea or vision, which leads to requirements gathering.
B → C: The Product Manager (PM) creates the ARD based on initial requirements.
C → D: The ARD is then reviewed and approved with stakeholders.
D → E: Once approved, detailed Feature Specifications are generated from the ARD.
E → F: Technical design and prototyping follow—this includes creating wireframes, API specifications, etc.
F → G: The finalized features are added to the product backlog and prioritized.
G → H: The development team begins implementation.
H → I: Iterative development continues with testing, user feedback, and refinements.
I → H: Feedback loops may result in additional development.
I → J: Finally, after successful testing and iteration, the application is deployed and maintained over time.
