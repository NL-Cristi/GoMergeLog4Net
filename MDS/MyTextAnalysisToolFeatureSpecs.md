- **US7:** As a user, I want the filter panel to display current filters and their states in real time.

### UI Elements & Interactions
- **Filter List:**  
  - Displays each filter entry with its text, a toggle (checkbox) for enabled state, and controls for deletion and ordering.
- **Create New Filter Button:**  
  - Located on the filter panel; clicking it opens the “Create New Filter” pop-up dialog.
- **Reordering Controls:**  
  - Up/Down arrow buttons or drag-and-drop functionality to change the order of filters.
- **Context Menu (Optional):**  
  - Right-clicking a filter entry could provide additional options (e.g., edit, delete).

### Workflow
- **Creating a New Filter:**
  1. User clicks the "Create New Filter" button on the filter panel (or uses the Edit menu).
  2. The system opens a pop-up dialog with input controls to specify the filter text and state.
  3. User inputs the filter criteria and clicks “Confirm”.
  4. The new filter is added to the list, and the Filter Manager updates the filtering on the text panel.
- **Editing/Deleting a Filter:**
  1. User selects a filter entry and either clicks an edit icon or right-clicks for a context menu.
  2. From the dialog, user can change the filter text or toggle its enabled state.
  3. A delete option removes the filter from the list.
- **Reordering Filters:**
  1. User selects the up/down controls to move a filter in the list.
  2. The Filter Manager updates the order, and the UI list is refreshed.

### Acceptance Criteria
- Filters are displayed clearly with their state and options.
- New filters can be created, and changes (update, delete, reorder) are immediately reflected in the UI.
- Updating a filter triggers a regeneration of the filtered view in the Text Panel.
- Reordering filters adjusts the internal ordering within the Filter Manager.

## 3. Right-Click Interaction & Create Filter Pop-Up

### Overview
The Text Panel supports a right-click context menu on any text row. Right-clicking a row provides an option to create a new filter using the full text of the clicked row as the default filter value.

### User Stories
- **US8:** As a user, I want to be able to right-click any text row and quickly create a new filter using that row’s content.
- **US9:** As a user, I want consistent access to the filter creation dialog (via right-click, filter panel button, and Edit menu).

### UI Elements & Interactions
- **Text Row Context Menu:**  
  - Triggered by right-clicking on any row in the Text Panel.
  - The context menu displays an option: “Create New Filter”.
- **Pop-Up Dialog for Filter Creation:**  
  - Pre-populates the text input with the complete text of the selected row.
  - Contains controls to toggle the filter enabled state and to confirm or cancel filter creation.

### Workflow
1. **User Right-Clicks on a Text Row:**
   - A context menu appears with "Create New Filter".
2. **Selection:**
   - User selects "Create New Filter" from the context menu.
3. **Pop-Up Dialog:**
   - The dialog opens with the selected text as the default.
   - User reviews and modifies the text if needed.
   - User confirms the creation of the filter.
4. **Filter Creation:**
   - The new filter is added to the Filter Panel, and filtering is applied.

### Acceptance Criteria
- Right-click brings up a context menu with the "Create New Filter" option.
- The Create Filter dialog pre-populates with the clicked row’s text.
- Filter creation via dialog updates the Filter Manager and triggers an update on the Text Panel.

## 5. File I/O and Asynchronous Operations

### Overview
The system must handle file operations (loading, chunked reading, and caching) in a responsive manner. For large files, the application uses a sliding window of chunks and supports asynchronous reading to keep the UI responsive.

### User Stories
- **US13:** As a user, I want large files to be processed efficiently in chunks to avoid performance delays.
- **US14:** As a user, I expect smooth scrolling and fast navigation, even when reading from disk.

### Technical Details
- **Chunked File Reading:**  
  - For files larger than 5 MB, data is loaded in fixed-size chunks (e.g., 10 MB).
  - A sliding window of three contiguous chunks is maintained.
  - Partial lines across chunks must be handled gracefully.
- **Full File Loading:**  
  - For files 5 MB or less, the entire file is loaded into memory.
- **Asynchronous Processing:**  
  - I/O operations may run in separate threads or tasks to ensure the UI remains responsive.

### Acceptance Criteria
- Large files do not freeze the UI.
- Scrolling from one chunk to the next is smooth, with minimal delay.
- Full file operations complete quickly for small files.
- Any errors in file reading are logged and communicated to the user gracefully.

- **Functional Tests:**  
  - File operations (load, reload, save, close) trigger the expected behaviors.
  - Creating, editing, deleting, and reordering filters work as specified.
  - Right-click operations open the context menu and filter dialog.
  - Menu items trigger actions with correct updates to the data and display.
- **Performance Tests:**  
  - Large file handling demonstrates smooth scrolling and minimal lag.
  - Asynchronous operations do not block the UI.
